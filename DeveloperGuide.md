Congruence, for Developers
==========================
Consistency through standards, harmony through self-actualization. 

Abstract
--------
Understanding and implementing a development methodology across a project in software is two-fold as a development 
manager. You have workflows and standards specific to a codebase and to a project. Although their dependencies on one
another are mutually exclusive, their patterns couldn't be more different.
